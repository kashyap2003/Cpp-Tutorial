If let supposed you have a programm a that is like a while loop and some where in between while loop you have
a memory leak that while loop may be in a thread and it is running always in may be 1sec or 2sec or may be 
1min and let suppose you are running this application for 2 years then you will have some mentanance break
to shut it down and restart by the time you will restart you know what this whole momory leak will always be
there with you meaning OS will always think that you are still using this memory.

If your application goes down OS will get all the memory back what it allocate for some perticular programm.
