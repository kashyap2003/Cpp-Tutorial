LValue and RValue in C++

Every expression in C++ is either Lvalue or RValue expression.

Lvalue: If you can take the address of expression then it is Lvalue, and they last extended period of time.
RValue: RValue are such expression which you can't take address and they are temporary, they don't exist after one line.

Examples:

int x = 10;      // x is Lvalue and 10 is RValue


int a =10, b=10;
int x = (a+b);      // x is Lvalue and a+b is RValue
int *p = &(a+b;)    // Error: (a+b) is not Lvalue


class Cat{};
Cat c = Cat();      // Cat() is an RValue


int square(int x) {return x*x;}
int sq = square(10);    // square(10) is an RValue
